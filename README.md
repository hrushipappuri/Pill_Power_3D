# Pill_Power_3D
Welcome to my Unity 3D game, inspired by the classic game Mario Kart! This game is created for ITCS-5231 Final Project Prototype

# Gameplay
The game is set across two levels, with an easy first level and a more challenging second level. The objective of the game is to collect coins, which are scattered throughout the levels, and to defeat enemies by jumping on top of them.
The game features a "Slippery" physical material, which makes the terrain more challenging to navigate. You'll need to be careful when turning or stopping, as your character can easily slide off the track.
